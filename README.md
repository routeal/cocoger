The project is on hold.

## What is cocoger?

cocoger is a location sharing mobile app.  Your location is rounded to administrative districts, such as town, city, states, and so on, so that your family and friends do not know your exact location but you can let them know that you are in the same town/state or alert when you enter the same town/state.
